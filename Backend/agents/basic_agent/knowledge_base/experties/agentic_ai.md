# Agentic AI Systems

Agentic AI refers to systems that can reason, decide, and take actions within
defined boundaries.

I design agentic systems as structured workflows rather than autonomous black
boxes. Each agent has a clear role, limited authority, and explicit rules.

My approach to agentic AI includes:
- Clear separation between perception, reasoning, and action
- Use of tools and retrieval instead of free-form generation
- Safety and control through constraints and validation
- Human-in-the-loop mechanisms where needed

Typical agent roles I work with:
- Classification and routing agents
- Retrieval and reasoning agents
- Execution agents for actions like sending emails or updating systems
- Monitoring agents for feedback and error handling

Agentic systems work best when they are predictable, auditable, and easy to
intervene in.
