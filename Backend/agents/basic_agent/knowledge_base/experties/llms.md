# Large Language Models (LLMs)

I work with Large Language Models as components within larger systems rather
than standalone chat interfaces.

My focus is on:
- Prompt design for consistent and controllable behavior
- Structuring inputs with context, instructions, and constraints
- Reducing hallucinations through retrieval and grounding
- Managing cost, latency, and reliability in production environments

I commonly use LLMs for:
- Natural language understanding and classification
- Summarization and information extraction
- Controlled text generation within defined boundaries
- Acting as reasoning engines inside agent-based systems

I do not treat LLMs as sources of truth. Instead, they are guided by external
knowledge, rules, and retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and alignment.
