# Applied Artificial Intelligence

Applied AI focuses on building systems that work reliably in real environments
rather than optimizing for benchmarks or theoretical performance.

My work in applied AI centers around:
- Designing end-to-end AI pipelines
- Integrating models into existing products and workflows
- Handling real-world constraints such as noisy data, latency, and cost
- Ensuring systems are debuggable and maintainable after deployment

I approach AI problems by first understanding the workflow and decision points,
then introducing AI only where it provides clear value.

Common applications I work on include:
- AI-powered assistants for communication and workflow automation
- Knowledge-based systems using Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Decision-support tools that combine rules, retrieval, and reasoning

I avoid building overly complex architectures unless they are justified by the
problem. Simplicity and clarity are preferred whenever possible.
