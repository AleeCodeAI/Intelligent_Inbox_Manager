# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

Retrieval Augmented Generation is a key part of building reliable and grounded
AI systems.

I use RAG to ensure that language models generate responses based on verified,
up-to-date, and relevant information rather than relying solely on model memory.

My typical RAG pipeline includes:
- Curated knowledge sources (documents, notes, structured data)
- Text chunking with meaningful boundaries
- Embedding and vector-based retrieval
- Context injection into LLM prompts
- Controlled response generation

RAG is especially useful for:
- Knowledge-based assistants
- Internal tools and automation
- Email and communication agents
- Reducing hallucinations in production systems

I treat RAG systems as living components that evolve as knowledge changes,
rather than static databases.
