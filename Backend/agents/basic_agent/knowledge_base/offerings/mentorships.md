# Mentorship

I offer limited mentorship for individuals who are serious about building
real-world skills in applied artificial intelligence.

Mentorship is focused on:
- Practical project guidance
- System design thinking
- Career direction in applied AI
- Reviewing architectures, ideas, and implementation choices

Mentorship is best suited for:
- Students or early professionals working on real projects
- Builders interested in RAG, LLMs, and agent-based systems
- People who prefer hands-on learning over theory-heavy approaches

I do not offer:
- Guaranteed job placement
- Step-by-step coding lessons
- Generic AI or machine learning tutoring

Mentorship is selective and time-bound to ensure high-quality guidance.
