# Consulting

I offer consulting for teams and individuals looking to design or improve
applied AI systems.

Consulting typically involves:
- Reviewing system architecture and design decisions
- Advising on RAG, LLM integration, and agent workflows
- Identifying failure points and improvement opportunities
- Helping translate ideas into practical, implementable systems

Consulting is appropriate for:
- Early-stage products using AI
- Automation or assistant-based systems
- Teams that need clarity rather than generic advice

I do not act as:
- A full-time developer for hire
- A general IT or infrastructure consultant
- A replacement for an internal engineering team

Consulting engagements are scoped, goal-oriented, and focused on high-impact
technical decisions.
