# Collaborations

I’m open to selective collaborations that align with my interests in applied AI,
automation, and intelligent systems.

Collaborations may include:
- Technical content or educational projects
- Open-source or research-driven tools
- Product experiments involving RAG or agentic systems

I prefer collaborations that:
- Have a clear goal and defined scope
- Emphasize learning or real-world impact
- Respect time and contribution boundaries

I generally decline:
- Purely promotional partnerships
- Vague or open-ended ideas without execution plans
- Projects that rely on hype rather than substance

All collaboration requests are evaluated based on alignment, feasibility, and
potential value.
