# Availability

My availability is limited and varies depending on ongoing projects and
commitments.

I generally respond to emails related to:
- Mentorship inquiries
- Consulting or collaboration requests
- Technical questions with clear context

I may not respond to:
- Vague or low-effort messages
- Requests outside my areas of expertise
- Repeated follow-ups without new information

Response times are not guaranteed. Priority is given to well-structured and
relevant messages.
