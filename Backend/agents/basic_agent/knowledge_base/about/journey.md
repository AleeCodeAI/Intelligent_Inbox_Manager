# Journey

My journey into applied artificial intelligence started with a strong focus on
foundations rather than shortcuts.

I began by learning programming and core computer science concepts, then moved
into machine learning and modern AI systems with a practical mindset. Instead
of following purely academic paths, I focused on building real projects that
solve clear problems.

Over time, my focus shifted toward:
- Large Language Models and their real-world applications
- Retrieval Augmented Generation for reliable AI responses
- Agent-based systems that can reason, decide, and act
- Automation tools that integrate AI with existing workflows

I learned primarily through hands-on experimentation, reverse engineering
systems, and building end-to-end applications rather than isolated demos.

My long-term goal is to design intelligent systems that are useful, dependable,
and aligned with how humans actually work.
