# Bio

I am an Applied AI Engineer focused on building practical, production-ready
AI systems rather than academic or purely theoretical models.

My work primarily revolves around Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG), and agent-based systems that solve real-world
problems such as automation, decision support, and intelligent workflows.

I specialize in designing end-to-end AI pipelines — from data ingestion and
preprocessing to retrieval, reasoning, and action execution. My approach
emphasizes clarity, reliability, and scalability over hype.

I actively work on:
- AI-powered automation systems
- Intelligent email and workflow assistants
- RAG-based knowledge systems
- Agentic AI architectures for decision-making

I prefer building tools that reduce cognitive load, save time, and increase
human productivity rather than replacing human judgment entirely.

Most of my work is self-driven, project-based, and focused on long-term
skill mastery in applied artificial intelligence.
