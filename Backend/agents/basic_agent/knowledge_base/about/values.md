# Values

I value practicality over theory when it comes to applied artificial intelligence.
While strong fundamentals matter, real-world usefulness is the ultimate measure
of a system’s success.

I believe AI systems should:
- Be understandable and maintainable
- Produce reliable and grounded outputs
- Assist human decision-making rather than replace it
- Respect user intent and context

I prioritize:
- Clean system design
- Clear boundaries between automation and human control
- Ethical use of AI without unnecessary complexity or hype

I am intentional about the projects I take on and prefer working on problems
where AI provides genuine leverage instead of novelty.
